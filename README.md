# 🧪 Analog Layouts using Magic VLSI (Sky130 PDK)

This repository contains analog circuit layouts designed using **Magic VLSI** and simulated with **NGSpice**. All designs are based on the open-source **Sky130 PDK**.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/layouts/` – Layout files (`.mag`) for capacitors, resistors, and potential dividers
- `/spice/` – Corresponding SPICE netlists for simulation
- `/layout-images/` – Screenshots of layout windows for reference

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Magic VLSI** – Layout editing and DRC
- **NGSpice** – Circuit simulation (transient, DC)
- **Sky130 PDK** – Open-source process design kit
- **Linux Environment** – Running simulations and tools

## 🔬 Designs Included

- ✅ Resistors: 5kΩ and 15kΩ
- ✅ Capacitors: Basic MOS capacitor
- ✅ Voltage Divider Circuits (2 versions)

## 🌱 Learning Outcomes

- Created basic analog layouts using Magic VLSI
- Learned how to extract `.ext` files and run SPICE simulations
- Understood layout-to-netlist flow
- Practiced layout capture and verification using screenshots
